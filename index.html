      <p>Why this car? </p>
      <p>If you don't already know, the Fast and Furious movies got me into cars and when I saw Paul Walker with the GTR, I said to myself that someday in the future I will get one. Currently the R34 is still illegal to import but 2024 is when you can legally import one. So the GTR I want to get is the R32 GTR.  </p>

      <p>Why do I have so many bikes?</p>
      <p>My first bicycle is of course from Walmart and it only lasted for a year, so my dad bought me a BMX bike, a P.K. Ripper, from Kauai Cycle then he bought a roadbike for himself and when we moved to Oahu he gave me the bike but then bought an electric roadbike.....Unfair LOL! </p>

       <h2 >About Me</h2>
      <img src="Kauai.jpg" width="130" height="90">
      <p><p style="color:black;"> Well first of all, my name is Kobe Matias, I am 17 years old, born and rasied on the island of Kauai. #Kauai as why! I lived there for 13 years then moved to Oahu druing 7th grade and to be honest with you, it was kind of hard being the new kid becaue I didn't knew anybody but after meeting new people, I made new friends. One of my hobbies is riding my bike just to watch the sunset or cruise around to clear my mind and to also get my excercise. I like watching youtube videos of building and designing cars and one day I will get my own car to try and build it. </p>

<h2 style="color:lightcoral;">Why am I in this Computer Science class?</h2>
   <p style="color:black;"> I joined this class to learn more about computers and to see how they are related to cars because the career I want to pursue, is an Automotive Technician. The reason I chose this career is because one of my uncles is one and I want to also learn more about how a cars technology can change over time. Also I had to take at least one AP class because of AVID. LOL! </p>  

    <h3 style="color:lightcoral;">What school do I want to go to?</h3>
    
 <p style="color:black;"> The school I want to go after high school is located in Avondale, Arizona which is called Universal Technical Institute. I chose this school because my uncle went to this school and he said that he enjoyed going there and it is a good path pursuing a career as a Technician.  </p>
